.. This file is hooked into a slide deck


A custom resource:

* Is a simple extension of Chef
* Is implemented as part of a cookbook
* Follows easy, repeatable syntax patterns
* Effectively leverages resources that are built into Chef
* Is reusable in the same way as resources that are built into Chef

For example, Chef includes built-in resources to manage files, packages, templates, and services, but it does not include a resource that manages websites.
