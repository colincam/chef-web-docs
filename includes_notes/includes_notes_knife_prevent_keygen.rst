This option is valid only with Chef server API, version 1.0, which was released with Chef server 12.1. If this option or the ``--user-key`` option are not passed in the command, the Chef server will create a user with a public key named ``default`` and will return the private key. For the Chef server versions earlier than 12.1, this option will not work; a public key is always generated unless ``--user-key`` is passed in the command.
