In many cases, it is better to use the **package** resource instead of this one. This is because when the **package** resource is used in a recipe, the chef-client will use details that are collected by Ohai at the start of the chef-client run to determine the correct package application. Using the **package** resource allows a recipe to be authored in a way that allows it to be used across many platforms.
