The following settings are often modified from the default as part of the tuning effort for the **opscode-erchef** service:

``opscode_erchef['db_pool_size']``
   The number of open connections to PostgreSQL that are maintained by the service. If failures indicate that the **opscode-erchef** service ran out of connections, try increasing the ``postgresql['max_connections']`` setting. If failures persist, then increase this value (in small increments) and also increase the value for ``postgresql['max_connections']``. Default value: ``20``.

``opscode_erchef['s3_url_ttl']``
   The amount of time (in seconds) before connections to the server expire. If chef-client runs are timing out, increase this setting to ``3600``, and then adjust again if necessary. Default value: ``900``.

``opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']``
   .. tag settings_strict_search_result_acls
   
   Use to specify that search results only return objects to which an actor (user, client, etc.) has read access, as determined by ACL settings. This affects all searches. When ``true``, the performance of the Chef management console may increase because it enables the Chef management console to skip redundant ACL checks. To ensure the Chef management console is configured properly, after this setting has been applied with a ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` run ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure`` to ensure the Chef management console also picks up the setting. Default value: ``false``.
   
   .. warning:: When ``true``, ``opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']`` affects all search results and any actor (user, client, etc.) that does not have read access to a search result will not be able to view it. For example, this could affect search results returned during chef-client runs if a chef-client does not have permission to read the information.
