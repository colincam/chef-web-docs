   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located. 
   
   ``:delayed``

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

``supports``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   A list of properties that controls how the chef-client is to attempt to manage a service: ``:restart``, ``:reload``, ``:status``. For ``:restart``, the init script or other service provider can use a restart command; if ``:restart`` is not specified, the chef-client attempts to stop and then start a service. For ``:reload``, the init script or other service provider can use a reload command. For ``:status``, the init script or other service provider can use a status command to determine if the service is running; if ``:status`` is not specified, the chef-client attempts to match the ``service_name`` against the process table as a regular expression, unless a pattern is specified as a parameter property. Default value: ``{ :restart => false, :reload => false, :status => false }`` for all platforms (except for the Red Hat platform family, which defaults to ``{ :restart => false, :reload => false, :status => true }``.)
   
``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out. Default value: ``60``.
