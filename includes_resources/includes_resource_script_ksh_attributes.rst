   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers
   
   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:
   
   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located. 
   
   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.
   
   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.
   
   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax
   
   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

``path``
   **Ruby Type:** Array

   An array of paths to use when searching for a command. These paths are not added to the command's environment $PATH. The default value uses the system path.

   .. warning:: .. tag resources_common_resource_execute_attribute_path
                
                The ``path`` property is not implemented by any provider in any version of the chef-client. Starting with chef-client 12, using the ``path`` property will return a warning. Starting with chef-client 13, the ``path`` property is deprecated and using it will return an exception. Cookbooks that currently use the ``path`` property should be updated to use the ``environment`` property instead.
