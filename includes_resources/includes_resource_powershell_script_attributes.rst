.. tag resource_powershell_script_attributes

This resource has the following properties:
   
``architecture``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   The architecture of the process under which a script is executed. If a value is not provided, the chef-client defaults to the correct value for the architecture, as determined by Ohai. An exception is raised when anything other than ``:i386`` is specified for a 32-bit process. Possible values: ``:i386`` (for 32-bit processes) and ``:x86_64`` (for 64-bit processes).
   
``code``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A quoted (" ") string of code to be executed.
   
``command``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Array

   The name of the command to be executed. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.
   
``convert_boolean_return``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Return ``0`` if the last line of a command is evaluated to be true or to return ``1`` if the last line is evaluated to be false. Default value: ``false``.

   When the ``guard_intrepreter`` common attribute is set to ``:powershell_script``, a string command will be evaluated as if this value were set to ``true``. This is because the behavior of this attribute is similar to the value of the ``"$?"`` expression common in UNIX interpreters. For example, this:
          
   .. code-block:: ruby
          
      powershell_script 'make_safe_backup' do
        guard_interpreter :powershell_script
        code 'cp ~/data/nodes.json ~/data/nodes.bak'
        not_if 'test-path ~/data/nodes.bak'
      end
   
   is similar to:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
          
      bash 'make_safe_backup' do
        code 'cp ~/data/nodes.json ~/data/nodes.bak'
        not_if 'test -e ~/data/nodes.bak'
      end
   
``creates``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Inherited from **execute** resource. Prevent a command from creating a file when that file already exists.
   
``cwd``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Inherited from **execute** resource. The current working directory from which a command is run.
   
``environment``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   Inherited from **execute** resource. A Hash of environment variables in the form of ``({"ENV_VARIABLE" => "VALUE"})``. (These variables must exist for a command to be run successfully.)
   
``flags``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A string that is passed to the Windows PowerShell command. Default value: ``-NoLogo, -NonInteractive, -NoProfile, -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned, -InputFormat None, -File``.
   
``group``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Integer

   Inherited from **execute** resource. The group name or group ID that must be changed before running a command.
   
``guard_interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   Default value: ``:powershell_script``. When this property is set to ``:powershell_script``, the 64-bit version of the Windows PowerShell shell will be used to evaluate strings values for the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` properties. Set this value to ``:default`` to use the 32-bit version of the cmd.exe shell.
   
``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.
   
``interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The script interpreter to use during code execution. Changing the default value of this property is not supported.
   
``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies
   
   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notifiy more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.
   
   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers
   
   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:
   
   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located. 
   
   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.
   
   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.
   
   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax
   
   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer
   
   .. end_tag
   
   
``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider.
   
``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.
   
``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.
   
``returns``

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes
   
   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.
   
   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers
   
   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:
   
   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located. 
   
   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.
   
   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax
   
   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
