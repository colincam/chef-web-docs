.. tag resource_registry_key_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:create``
   Default. Create a registry key. If a registry key already exists (but does not match), update that registry key to match.

``:create_if_missing``
   Create a registry key if it does not exist. Also, create a registry key value if it does not exist.

``:delete``
   Delete the specified values for a registry key.

``:delete_key``
   Delete the specified registry key and all of its subkeys.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing
   
   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the chef-client run.
   
   .. end_tag
   

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_resource_recursive
          
          Be careful when using the ``:delete_key`` action with the ``recursive`` attribute. This will delete the registry key, all of its values and all of the names, types, and data associated with them. This cannot be undone by the chef-client.
