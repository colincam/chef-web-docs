.. tag resource_registry_key_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``architecture``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   The architecture of the node for which keys are to be created or deleted. Possible values: ``:i386`` (for nodes with a 32-bit registry), ``:x86_64`` (for nodes with a 64-bit registry), and ``:machine`` (to have the chef-client determine the architecture during the chef-client run). Default value: ``:machine``.

   In order to read or write 32-bit registry keys on 64-bit machines running Microsoft Windows, the ``architecture`` property must be set to ``:i386``. The ``:x86_64`` value can be used to force writing to a 64-bit registry location, but this value is less useful than the default (``:machine``) because the chef-client returns an exception if ``:x86_64`` is used and the machine turns out to be a 32-bit machine (whereas with ``:machine``, the chef-client is able to access the registry key on the 32-bit machine).

   .. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_architecture
             
             The ``ARCHITECTURE`` attribute should only specify ``:x86_64`` or ``:i386`` when it is necessary to write 32-bit (``:i386``) or 64-bit (``:x86_64``) values on a 64-bit machine. ``ARCHITECTURE`` will default to ``:machine`` unless a specific value is given.
             
             .. end_tag
             
   
``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.
   
``key``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to the location in which a registry key is to be created or from which a registry key is to be deleted. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.
   The path must include the registry hive, which can be specified either as its full name or as the 3- or 4-letter abbreviation. For example, both ``HKLM\SECURITY`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`` are both valid and equivalent. The following hives are valid: ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``, ``HKLM``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG``, ``HKCC``, ``HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT``, ``HKCR``, ``HKEY_USERS``, ``HKU``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``, and ``HKCU``.
   
``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies
   
   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notifiy more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.
   
   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers
   
   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:
   
   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located. 
   
   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.
   
   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.
   
   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax
   
   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer
   
   .. end_tag
   
   
``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider.
   
``recursive``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   When creating a key, this value specifies that the required keys for the specified path are to be created. When using the ``:delete_key`` action in a recipe, and if the registry key has subkeys, then set the value for this property to ``true``.

   .. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_resource_recursive
             
             Be careful when using the ``:delete_key`` action with the ``recursive`` attribute. This will delete the registry key, all of its values and all of the names, types, and data associated with them. This cannot be undone by the chef-client.
             
             .. end_tag
             
   
``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.
   
``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.
   
``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes
   
   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.
   
   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers
   
   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:
   
   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located. 
   
   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.
   
   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.
   
   .. end_tag
   

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax
   
   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer
   
   .. end_tag
   
   
``values``
   **Ruby Types:** Hash, Array

   An array of hashes, where each Hash contains the values that are to be set under a registry key. Each Hash must contain ``:name``, ``:type``, and ``:data`` (and must contain no other key values).
       
   ``:type`` represents the values available for registry keys in Microsoft Windows. Use ``:binary`` for REG_BINARY, ``:string`` for REG_SZ, ``:multi_string`` for REG_MULTI_SZ, ``:expand_string`` for REG_EXPAND_SZ, ``:dword`` for REG_DWORD, ``:dword_big_endian`` for REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, or ``:qword`` for REG_QWORD.

   .. warning:: ``:multi_string`` must be an array, even if there is only a single string.
