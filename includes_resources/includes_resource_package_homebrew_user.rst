.. tag resource_package_homebrew_user

The chef-client, by default, will attempt to execute a Homebrew command as the owner of ``/usr/local/bin/brew``. If that executable does not exist, the chef-client will attempt to find the user by executing ``which brew``. If that executable cannot be found, the chef-client will print an error message: ``Could not find the "brew" executable in /usr/local/bin or anywhere on the path.``. Use the ``homebrew_user`` attribute to specify the Homebrew owner for situations where the chef-client cannot automatically detect the correct owner.
