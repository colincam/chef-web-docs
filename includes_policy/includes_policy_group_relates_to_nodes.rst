Each node has a 1:many relationship with policy settings stored on the Chef server. This relationship is based on the policy group to which the node is associated, and then the policy settings assigned to that group:

* A policy is typically named after the functional role ahost performs, such as "application server", "chat server", "load balancer", and so on
* A policy group defines a set of hosts in a deployed units, typically mapped to organizational requirements such as "dev", "test", "staging", and "production", but can also be mapped to more detailed requirements as needed
