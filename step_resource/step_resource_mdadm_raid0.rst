.. tag resource_mdadm_raid0

The mdadm command can be used to create RAID arrays. For example, a RAID 0 array named ``/dev/md0`` with 10 devices would have a command similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=10 /dev/s01.../dev/s10

where ``/dev/s01 .. /dev/s10`` represents 10 devices (01, 02, 03, and so on). This same command, when expressed as a recipe using the **mdadm** resource, would be similar to:

.. code-block:: ruby

   mdadm '/dev/md0' do
     devices [ '/dev/s01', ... '/dev/s10' ]
     level 0
     action :create
   end

(again, where ``/dev/s01 .. /dev/s10`` represents devices /dev/s01, /dev/s02, /dev/s03, and so on).

.. end_tag
