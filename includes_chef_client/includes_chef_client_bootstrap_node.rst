A node is any physical, virtual, or cloud machine that is configured to be maintained by a chef-client. A bootstrap is a process that installs the chef-client on a target system so that it can run as a chef-client and communicate with a Chef server. There are two ways to do this:

* Use the ``knife bootstrap`` subcommand to :doc:`bootstrap a node using the omnibus installer </install_bootstrap>`
* Use an unattended install to bootstrap a node from itself, without using SSH or WinRM
