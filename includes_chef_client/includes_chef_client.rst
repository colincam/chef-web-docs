A chef-client is an agent that runs locally on every node that is under management by Chef. When a chef-client is run, it will perform all of the steps that are required to bring the node into the expected state, including:

* Registering and authenticating the node with the Chef server
* Building the node object
* Synchronizing cookbooks
* Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies
* Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node
* Looking for exceptions and notifications, handling each as required
