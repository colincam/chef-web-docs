.. tag dsl_recipe_control_matcher_package_not_installed

A package that is not installed:

.. code-block:: ruby

   control_group 'audit name' do
     control 'postgres package' do
       it 'should not be installed' do
         expect(package('postgresql')).to_not be_installed
       end
     end
   end

If the audit was successful, the chef-client will return output similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   Audit Mode
     postgres audit
       postgres package
         is not installed

.. end_tag
