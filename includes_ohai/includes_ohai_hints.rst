Ohai hints are used to tell Ohai something about the system that it is running on that it would not be able to discover itself. An Ohai hint exists if a JSON file exists in the hint directory with the same name as the hint. For example, calling ``hint?('antarctica')`` in an Ohai plugin would return an empty hash if the file ``antarctica.json`` existed in the hints directory, and return nil if the file does not exist.
