To install the ``knife reporting`` plugin using RubyGems, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-reporting

where ``/opt/chef/embedded/bin/`` is the path to the location where the chef-client expects knife plugins to be located. If the chef-client was installed using RubyGems, omit the path in the previous example.
