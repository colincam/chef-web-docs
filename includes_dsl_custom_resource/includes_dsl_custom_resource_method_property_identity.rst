.. tag dsl_custom_resource_method_property_identity

Add ``identity:`` to set a resource to a particular set of properties. This value may be ``true`` or ``false``.

* When ``true``, data for that property is returned as part of the resource data set and may be available to external applications, such as reporting
* When ``false``, no data for that property is returned.

If no properties are marked ``true``, the property that defaults to the ``name`` of the resource is marked ``true``.

For example, the following properties define ``username`` and ``password`` properties with no default values specified, but with ``identity`` set to ``true`` for the user name:

.. code-block:: ruby

   property :username, String, identity: true
   property :password, String


.. end_tag
