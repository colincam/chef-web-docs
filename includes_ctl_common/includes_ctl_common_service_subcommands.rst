This command has a built in process supervisor that ensures all of the required services are in the appropriate state at any given time. The supervisor starts two processes per service and provides the following subcommands for managing services: ``hup``, ``int``, ``kill``, ``once``, ``restart``, ``service-list``, ``start``, ``status``, ``stop``, ``tail``, and ``term``.
