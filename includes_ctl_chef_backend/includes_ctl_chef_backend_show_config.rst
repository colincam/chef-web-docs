.. tag ctl_chef_backend_show_config

The ``show-config`` subcommand is used to view the configuration that will be generated by the ``reconfigure`` subcommand. This command is most useful in the early stages of a deployment to ensure that everything is built properly prior to installation. 

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-backend-ctl show-config

.. end_tag
