.. tag handler_custom_example_cookbook_versions

Community member ``juliandunn`` created a custom `report handler that logs all of the cookbooks and cookbook versions <https://github.com/juliandunn/cookbook_versions_handler>`_ that were used during the chef-client run, and then reports after the run is complete. This handler requires the **chef_handler** resource (which is available from the **chef_handler** cookbook).
