The chef-repo is the repository structure in which cookbooks are authored, tested, and maintained:

* Cookbooks contain recipes, attributes, custom resources, libraries, definitions, files, templates, tests, and metadata
* The chef-repo should be synchronized with a version control system (such as git), and then managed as if it were source code
