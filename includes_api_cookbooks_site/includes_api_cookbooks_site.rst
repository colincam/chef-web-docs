The Cookbooks Site API is used to provide access to the cookbooks community hosted at |url community_cookbooks|. All of the cookbooks in the community are accessible through a RESTful API located at |url api_cookbooks| by using any of the supported endpoints. In most cases, using knife is the best way to interact with these cookbooks; in some cases, using the Cookbooks Site API directly is necessary.
