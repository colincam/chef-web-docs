.. tag search_pattern_range

A range matching search pattern is used to query for values that are within a range defined by upper and lower boundaries. A range matching search pattern can be inclusive or exclusive of the boundaries. Use square brackets ("[ ]") to denote inclusive boundaries and curly braces ("{ }") to denote exclusive boundaries and with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

   boundary TO boundary

where ``TO`` is required (and must be capitalized).

.. end_tag
