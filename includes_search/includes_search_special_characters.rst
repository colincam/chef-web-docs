.. tag search_special_characters

A special character can be used to fine-tune a search query and to increase the accuracy of the search results. The following characters can be included within the search query syntax, but each occurrence of a special character must be escaped with a backslash (``\``):

.. code-block:: ruby

   +  -  &&  | |  !  ( )  { }  [ ]  ^  "  ~  *  ?  :  \

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   \(1\+1\)\:2

.. end_tag
