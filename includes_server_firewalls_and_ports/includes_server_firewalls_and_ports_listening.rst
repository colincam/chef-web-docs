All services must be listening on the appropriate ports. Most monitoring systems provide a means of testing whether a given port is accepting connections and service-specific tools may also be available. In addition, the generic system tool Telnet can also be used to initiate the connection:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ telnet HOST_NAME PORT


.. end_tag
