Use the Handler DSL to attach a callback to an event. If the event occurs during the chef-client run, the associated callback is executed. For example:

* Sending email if a chef-client run fails
* Sending a notification to chat application if an audit run fails
* Aggregating statistics about resources updated during a chef-client runs to StatsD
