The Chef extension on the Azure portal may be used on the following platforms:

* Windows Server 2012, 2012r2
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS

.. note:: Virtual machines running on Microsoft Azure can also be provisioned from the command-line using the ``knife azure`` plugin for knife. This approach is ideal for cases that require automation or for users who are more suited to command-line interfaces.
