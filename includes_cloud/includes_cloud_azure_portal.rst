Microsoft Azure is a cloud hosting platform from Microsoft that provides virtual machines. The Azure production portal (|url azure_production|) can boostrap Microsoft Windows-based virtual machines that are already provisioned with the chef-client running as a background service. Once provisioned, these virtual machines are ready to be managed by Chef.

To use the Chef integration with the Azure portal, all you need is a Chef server and the Azure portal. `Choose a Chef version <http://www.chef.io/chef/choose-your-version/>`_ or deploy a Chef server via the Azure Marketplace (|url azure_marketplace|).
