Some knife commands, such as ``knife data bag edit``, require that information be edited as JSON data using a text editor. For example, the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife data bag edit admins admin_name

will open up the text editor with data similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "id": "admin_name"
   }

Changes to that file can then be made:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "id": "Justin C."
     "description": "I am passing the time by letting time pass over me ..."
   }

The type of text editor that is used by knife can be configured by adding an entry to the knife.rb file or by setting an ``EDITOR`` environment variable. For example, to configure the text editor to always open with vim, add the following to the knife.rb file:

.. code-block:: ruby

   knife[:editor] = "/usr/bin/vim"

When a Microsoft Windows file path is enclosed in a double-quoted string (" "), the same backslash character (``\``) that is used to define the file path separator is also used in Ruby to define an escape character. The knife.rb file is a Ruby file; therefore, file path separators must be escaped. In addition, spaces in the file path must be replaced with ``~1`` so that the length of each section within the file path is not more than 8 characters. For example, if EditPad Pro is the text editor of choice and is located at the following path::

   C:\\Program Files (x86)\EditPad Pro\EditPad.exe

the setting in the knife.rb file would be similar to:

.. code-block:: ruby

   knife[:editor] = "C:\\Progra~1\\EditPa~1\\EditPad.exe"

One approach to working around the double- vs. single-quote issue is to put the single-quotes outside of the double-quotes. For example, for Notepad++:

.. code-block:: ruby

   knife[:editor] = '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" -nosession -multiInst'

for Sublime Text:

.. code-block:: ruby

   knife[:editor] = '"C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2\sublime_text.exe" --wait'

for TextPad:

.. code-block:: ruby

   knife[:editor] = '"C:\Program Files (x86)\TextPad 7\TextPad.exe"'

and for vim:

.. code-block:: ruby

   knife[:editor] = '"C:\Program Files (x86)\vim\vim74\gvim.exe"'
