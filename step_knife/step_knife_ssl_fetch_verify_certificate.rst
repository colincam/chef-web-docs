.. tag knife_ssl_fetch_verify_certificate

The SSL certificate that is downloaded to the ``/.chef/trusted_certs`` directory should be verified to ensure that it is, in fact, the same certificate as the one located on the Chef server. This can be done by comparing the SHA-256 checksums.

#. View the checksum on the Chef server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ssh ubuntu@chef-server.example.com sudo sha256sum /var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/chef-server.example.com.crt

   The response is similar to:

   .. code-block:: bash

      <ABC123checksum>  /var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/chef-server.example.com.crt

#. View the checksum on the workstation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ gsha256sum .chef/trusted_certs/chef-server.example.com.crt

   The response is similar to:

   .. code-block:: bash

      <ABC123checksum>  .chef/trusted_certs/chef-server.example.com.crt

#. Verify that the checksum values are identical.
