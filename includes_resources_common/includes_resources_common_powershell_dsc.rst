Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a feature of Windows PowerShell that provides `a set of language extensions, cmdlets, and resources <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn249912.aspx>`_ that can be used to declaratively configure software. DSC is similar to Chef, in that both tools are idempotent, take similar approaches to the concept of resources, describe the configuration of a system, and then take the steps required to do that configuration. The most important difference between Chef and DSC is that Chef uses Ruby and DSC is exposed as configuration data from within Windows PowerShell.
