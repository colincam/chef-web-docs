# chef-web-docs

This repo is the source of the Chef reference documentation located at https://docs.chef.io/

On October 24, 2016, it became much easier to contribute to Chef reference documentation. For each topic, you now only have to make edits to a single file that looks a lot like the final HTML. 

## The fastest way to contribute

If you spot something in the docs that needs to be fixed, the fastest way to get the change in is to edit the file on the GitHub web site. To do this, navigate to the [chef_master/source](https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/tree/master/chef_master/source) directory and click on a file to edit. The file names are the same as the names in the [https://docs.chef.io](docs.chef.io) URL. 

When you're in the topic you want to change, click on that page's pencil icon and make your changes. You can preview how they'll look right on the page ("Preview Changes" tab). 

We no longer use "swaps" and include files, so you'll be able to see all of text in one place for each topic. If you need tips on the source language, check out these [instructions](https://docs.chef.io/style_guide.html). 

When you're done editing, press the "Propose file change" button at the bottom of the page and confirm your pull request. Our CI system will check for errors and add an comment to your PR with the results.

The Chef docs team can normally merge pull requests within a day or two, unless there are complications like build errors that might add a few more days.

## The next fastest way

If your change involves edits to multiple topics, or if you contribute frequently, you'll want to fork this repo in GitHib, clone it on your workstation, and make pull requests from commits you push to your forked repo. To clone, use

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs.git
```

Before submitting a PR, run the shell command `make master` to check for errors and build a local version of the doc set in html for testing. The docs build in a minute or two. To view the local version you built, open the file `build/index.html` in your browser.

Before running `make master` for the first time, you'll need to install Sphinx, the documentation generator, possibly using `sudo`:

```bash
  pip install sphinx==1.2.3
```
We currently require version 1.2.3 of [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). You may also need to install Python, depending on your system. 

If you need tips on the source language for the docs, check out the [instructions](https://docs.chef.io/style_guide.html). We use a subset of [restructuredText](https://docs.chef.io/style_guide.html) that's similar in scope to markdown.

## Tagged regions

We studied how to make contributing to this doc set as easy as possible. We ended up choosing an approach that uses tagged regions delimited by `.. tag` and `.. end_tag` lines to denote shared blocks of text. The tagged regions act like include files, but they're visible inline and therefore easier to edit.

For more information about how tagged regions work and how our new `dtags` tool helps manage them, see the [`dtags` README file](doctools/dtags_readme.md) and [`dtags` reference](doctools/dtags_help.md).

## Sending feedback

We love getting feedback. You can use:

* Email --- Send an email to docs@chef.io for documentation bugs, ideas, thoughts, and suggestions. This email address is not a support email address, however. If you need support, contact Chef support.
* Pull request --- Submit a PR to this repo using either of the two methods described above.
* GitHub issues --- Use the https://github.com/chef/chef/issues page for issues specific to Chef itself. This is a good place for "important" documentation bugs that may need visibility among a larger group, especially in situations where a doc bug may also surface a product bug.
* https://discourse.chef.io/ --- This is a great place to interact with Chef and others.
