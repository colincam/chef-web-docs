.. tag knife_client_create_options

This argument has the following options:

``-a``, ``--admin``
   Create a client as an admin client. This is required for any user to access Open Source Chef as an administrator.  This option only works when used with the open source Chef server and will have no effect when used with Enterprise Chef or Chef server 12.x.

``-f FILE``, ``--file FILE``
   Save a private key to the specified file name.

``-k``, ``--prevent-keygen``
   Create a user without a public key. This key may be managed later by using the ``knife user key`` subcommands.

   .. note:: .. tag notes_knife_prevent_keygen
             
             This option is valid only with Chef server API, version 1.0, which was released with Chef server 12.1. If this option or the ``--user-key`` option are not passed in the command, the Chef server will create a user with a public key named ``default`` and will return the private key. For the Chef server versions earlier than 12.1, this option will not work; a public key is always generated unless ``--user-key`` is passed in the command.
             
             .. end_tag
             

``-p FILE``, ``--public-key FILE``
   The path to a file that contains the public key. This option may not be passed in the same command with ``--prevent-keygen``. When using Open Source Chef a default key is generated if this option is not passed in the command. For Chef server version 12.x, see the ``--prevent-keygen`` option.

``--validator``
   Create the client as the chef-validator. Default value: ``true``.
