The ``knife exec`` subcommand uses the knife configuration file to execute Ruby scripts in the context of a fully configured chef-client. Use this subcommand to run scripts that will only access Chef server one time (or otherwise very infrequently) or any time that an operation does not warrant full usage of the knife subcommand library.
