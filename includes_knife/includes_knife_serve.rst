Use the ``knife serve`` subcommand to run a persistent chef-zero against the local chef-repo. (chef-zero is a lightweight Chef server that runs in-memory on the local machine.) This is the same as running the chef-client executable with the ``--local-mode`` option. The ``chef_repo_path`` is located automatically and the Chef server will bind to the first available port between ``8889`` and ``9999``. ``knife serve`` will print the URL for the local Chef server, so that it may be added to the knife.rb file.
